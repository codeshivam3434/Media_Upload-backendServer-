go to npm and read about file upload
you can access the uploaded file using "req.files.foo" here foo is input name for the file 

app.post('/upload',function(req,res){
    console.log(req.files.foo);//the uploaded file object 
});

req.files.foo.name:"car.jpg"

app.use(fileUpload({
    useTempFiles:true,
